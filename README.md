Welcome to Hyperbolic Paint!

To do:
- Test on mobile and adapt any parts that don't work right

Planned features:
- Zooming in and out.
- Animation of shapes via Mobius transformations. Animations will be started and stopped with a button, and a slider will change the speed. I have three animation types planned: the first two will be rotations and translations, and will be determined by placing an 'animation shape' (a point for rotations and a line for translations). Once the animation is playing, the animation shape will be draggable and will update the animation live. Finally, I'd like to add an interface so that the user can input any Mobius transformation they want and see what it does to their drawings.
- A form from which user can send feedback, removing the need to share their email with me if they don't want to.
- Styling of shapes, e.g., changing their line thickness and color.
- The ability to copy and paste shapes more easily. In particular, I'd like to be able to create tesselations given a fundamental domain.
